# Pb-UTILS

Usaly my releases won't need any framework only this util functions

## Targets | Notify | Menus
All of that could be change by you in modules with name

### Target:
* addGlobalVehicleTarget
* addSphereTarget
* addTargetToEntity
* deleteZone
  
### Notify
* notify

### Menus
* inputDialog

I use ox_lib and ox_target by default but you could change 

## Locales
If you want to use my locales need to add an convar with name pb:locale in server.cfg or any cfg file you have

Example:
setr pb:locale "pt"

I used ox_lib Locales, callbacks and points.

But the idea is you can chage it for your or QBCore for example if you want to
