# Pb-UTILS

Used for all my realeases don't usaly my releases won't need any framework only this util functions

## Targets | Notify | Menus
All of that could be change by you in modules with name

### Target:
* addGlobalVehicleTarget
* addSphereTarget
* addTargetToEntity
* deleteZone

I use ox_lib and ox_target by default but you could change 

## Locales
If you want to use my locales need to add an convar with name pb:locale in server.cfg or any cfg file you have

Example:
setr pb:locale "pt"
